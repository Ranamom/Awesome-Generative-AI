## Where do I Start? ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

To kick-start a career in data science and AI, mastering a programming language is crucial, though not absolutely essential. Python, a general-purpose scripting language, currently tops the popularity charts among data scientists, closely followed by R, a language specifically tailored for statistical analysis and replete with a plethora of statistical tools from the get-go.

The reason for [Python's](https://www.python.org/) popularity in the scientific community stems largely from its user-friendliness and an extensive, vibrant ecosystem of user-generated packages. For installing these packages, Python offers two primary methods: Pip, the default package manager (utilised via the 'pip install' command), and Anaconda, a more comprehensive package manager that not only manages Python and R packages but also handles software like Git.

Whilst [R](https://www.r-project.org/) was specifically designed with statistical operations in mind, Python was not initially developed with data science as its core focus. However, it more than makes up for this with a rich array of third-party libraries. Although this document will later detail a more exhaustive list of such packages, beginning with these four could be immensely beneficial: [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/). Scikit-Learn is a versatile data science library covering most popular algorithms, complete with extensive documentation, tutorials, and practical examples. Pandas is ideal for organising and analysing data in table format, while Numpy offers swift tools for mathematical calculations, focusing on vector and matrix operations. Seaborn, built upon Matplotlib, enables the easy creation of attractive data visualisations, with numerous defaults and a gallery showcasing various common visualisations.

Choosing between Python and R for your data science journey isn't critical, as both languages have their unique strengths and weaknesses. The key is to select the one that resonates with you. To gain a better understanding of these languages and their application in AI, consider exploring some of the free courses we've recommended. These courses are designed to provide a comprehensive introduction and are a fantastic way to begin your journey in the ever-evolving field of AI and data science.
