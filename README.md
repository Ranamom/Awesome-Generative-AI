| --- | --- |
| [What is generative AI? - McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-generative-ai) | Generative artificial intelligence (AI) describes algorithms (such as ChatGPT) that can be used to create new content, including audio, code, images, text, simulations, and videos. Recent breakthroughs in the field have the potential to drastically change the way we approach content creation. 
| [What is generative AI? - Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/topics/generative-ai) | Generative AI can learn from existing artifacts to generate new, realistic artifacts (at scale) that reflect the characteristics of the training data but don’t repeat it. It can produce a variety of novel content, such as images, video, music, speech, text, software code and product designs.   |
| [What is Generative AI? - Nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/) | Generative AI enables users to quickly generate new content based on a variety of inputs. Inputs and outputs to these models can include text, images, sounds, animation, 3D models, or other types of data. |
| [What Is Generative AI: A Super-Simple Explanation Anyone Can Understand- Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/09/19/what-is-generative-ai-a-super-simple-explanation-anyone-can-understand/) | The term AI, as it's used today, refers to computer algorithms that can effectively simulate human cognitive processes - learning, decision-making, problem-solving, and even creativity. |
| [The Turing Lectures: What is generative AI?](https://www.turing.ac.uk/events/turing-lectures-what-generative-ai) | Generative AI refers to a type of artificial intelligence that involves creating new and original data or content. Unlike traditional AI models that rely on large datasets and algorithms to classify or predict outcomes, generative AI models are designed to learn the underlying patterns and structure of the data and generate novel outputs that mimic human creativity.   |

##### Papers
* [Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903) - Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models (2022): Using few-shot prompts to ask models to think step by step improves their reasoning. PaLM's score on math word problems (GSM8K) rises from 18% to 57%.
* [Self-Consistency Improves Chain of Thought Reasoning in Language Models (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11171) - Taking votes from multiple outputs improves accuracy even more. Voting across 40 outputs raises PaLM's score on math word problems further, from 57% to 74%, and code-davinci-002's from 60% to 78%.
* [Tree of Thoughts: Deliberate Problem Solving with Large Language Models (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601) - Searching over trees of step by step reasoning helps even more than voting over chains of thought. It lifts GPT-4's scores on creative writing and crosswords.
* [Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11916) - Telling instruction-following models to think step by step improves their reasoning. It lifts text-davinci-002's score on math word problems (GSM8K) from 13% to 41%.
* [Large Language Models Are Human-Level Prompt Engineers (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01910) - Automated searching over possible prompts found a prompt that lifts scores on math word problems (GSM8K) to 43%, 2 percentage points above the human-written prompt in Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners.
* [Reprompting: Automated Chain-of-Thought Prompt Inference Through Gibbs Sampling (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09993) - Automated searching over possible chain-of-thought prompts improved ChatGPT's scores on a few benchmarks by 0–20 percentage points.
* [Faithful Reasoning Using Large Language Models (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14271) - Chains of thought generated by alternative selection and inference prompts, a halter model that chooses when to halt selection-inference loops...
* [STaR: Bootstrapping Reasoning With Reasoning (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14465) - Chain of thought reasoning can be baked into models via fine-tuning. For tasks with an answer key, example chains of thoughts can be generated by language models.
* [ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) - For tasks with tools or an environment, chain of thought works better if you prescriptively alternate between Reasoning steps (thinking about what to do) and Acting (getting information from a tool or environment).
* [Reflexion: an autonomous agent with dynamic memory and self-reflection (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366) - Retrying tasks with memory of prior failures improves subsequent performance.
* [Demonstrate-Search-Predict: Composing retrieval and language models for knowledge-intensive NLP (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14024) - Composing retrieval and language models for knowledge-intensive NLP (2023)
* [Improving Factuality and Reasoning in Language Models through Multiagent Debate (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14325) - Generating debates between a few ChatGPT agents over a few rounds improves scores on various benchmarks. Math word problem scores rise from 77% to 85%.
